# hackathon-wow-detector

## Goal

Identify and amplify the single strongest wow-factor moment in a hackathon project, ensuring it is front-loaded in the demo and pitch for maximum judge impact.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- MVP features are defined and the demo flow is drafted from `hackathon-scope-cutter`
- The team needs to identify which feature to lead with in the demo
- Multiple candidate features exist and priority must be established
- The demo narrative lacks a clear climactic moment judges will remember
- Invoked during Phase 3 (Scope Definition), after `hackathon-scope-cutter`; output feeds both demo and pitch skills

## Inputs

| Input              | Type     | Required | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `project_title`    | string   | Yes      | Name of the project                              |
| `mvp_features`     | object[] | Yes      | MVP features from `hackathon-scope-cutter`       |
| `mvp_demo_flow`    | object[] | Yes      | Demo steps from `hackathon-scope-cutter`         |
| `target_user`      | string   | Yes      | Primary user segment                             |
| `evaluation_axes`  | object[] | Yes      | Judging criteria from `hackathon-track-analyzer` |
| `competitor_ideas` | string[] | No       | Other projects in the same track, if known       |

## Outputs

| Output                      | Description                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `wow_moments`               | All candidate wow moments ranked by impact           |
| `primary_wow_moment`        | The single strongest moment to lead with             |
| `amplification_tactics`     | How to make the primary wow moment land harder       |
| `demo_placement`            | Where in the demo/pitch the wow moment should appear |
| `judge_reaction_prediction` | What judges will likely think/say after seeing it    |
| `differentiation_statement` | One sentence that separates this project from others |

---

## Rules

1. Evaluate each feature for emotional impact, novelty, and relevance to `evaluation_axes`.
2. Select `primary_wow_moment` as the feature with highest combined impact × judging weight.
3. `primary_wow_moment` must be demonstrable live, not just described.
4. `amplification_tactics` must include at least: visual framing, narration timing, contrast setup.
5. `demo_placement` must be within the first 40% of the demo runtime.
6. `differentiation_statement` must be falsifiable — it must not apply to generic projects.
7. If `competitor_ideas` are known, ensure `differentiation_statement` is distinct from all of them.

## Example

**Input:**

```yaml
project_title: 'AnchorAI'
target_user: 'College students with anxiety'
mvp_features:
  - feature: 'GPT-4 check-in conversation'
  - feature: 'Session memory — AI recalls prior emotional context'
  - feature: 'Crisis escalation card (mocked)'
evaluation_axes:
  - axis: 'Innovation'
    weight: 'high'
  - axis: 'Impact'
    weight: 'high'
  - axis: 'Technical Execution'
    weight: 'medium'
```

**Output:**

```yaml
wow_moments:
  - rank: 1
    feature: 'Session memory — AI recalls prior emotional context'
    impact_score: 9
    novelty_score: 8
    judging_relevance: 9
    combined_score: 26
    description: "Judges will feel the emotional resonance of an AI that 'knows' the user — this feels like magic"
  - rank: 2
    feature: 'Crisis escalation card'
    impact_score: 7
    novelty_score: 4
    judging_relevance: 8
    combined_score: 19
    description: 'Demonstrates responsible AI and real-world impact; earns trust from judges'

primary_wow_moment:
  feature: 'Session memory — AI recalls prior emotional context'
  description: "In a new chat session, the AI opens with a reference to the user's emotional state from a previous session without being prompted."
  live_demonstrable: true

amplification_tactics:
  - tactic: 'Contrast setup'
    description: 'Before showing memory, demonstrate a generic AI response with no context. Then switch to AnchorAI. The contrast makes the memory recall land 3× harder.'
  - tactic: 'Narration pause'
    description: 'After the AI references prior context, stop talking for 2 seconds. Let judges process what they just saw.'
  - tactic: 'Visual framing'
    description: 'Zoom into or highlight the specific phrase in the AI response that references prior context.'

demo_placement:
  position: '38% (approximately 45 seconds into a 2-minute demo)'
  context: 'Immediately follows a neutral opening exchange to establish baseline AI behavior'

judge_reaction_prediction: "Judges will lean forward and say 'wait, how does it know that?' — this triggers the key question that lets the team explain their technical approach."

differentiation_statement: 'Unlike every other mental health AI demo today, AnchorAI remembers what you told it last week and uses it to open the next conversation — without being asked.'
```
