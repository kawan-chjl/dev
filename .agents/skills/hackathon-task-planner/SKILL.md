  Decompose MVP scope into a time-boxed task list with assigned roles, dependencies, and a critical path.

# hackathon-task-planner

## Goal

Decompose the MVP scope into a sequenced, time-boxed task list with assigned roles and clear dependencies for execution during the hackathon.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- MVP features with time budgets are available from `hackathon-scope-cutter`
- The team needs a structured task list before coding begins
- Roles and parallel workstreams need to be defined
- The critical path must be identified to protect the demo timeline
- Invoked once per project during Phase 4; re-invoke if scope is cut during implementation

## Inputs

| Input                      | Type     | Required | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mvp_features`             | object[] | Yes      | MVP features with time budgets from `hackathon-scope-cutter` |
| `tech_stack`               | string[] | Yes      | Technologies being used                                      |
| `team_size`                | integer  | Yes      | Number of team members                                       |
| `team_roles`               | string[] | No       | Role labels (e.g., frontend, backend, ML, design)            |
| `hackathon_duration_hours` | integer  | Yes      | Total hours available                                        |
| `start_offset_hours`       | integer  | No       | Hours already elapsed since hackathon start (default: 0)     |

## Outputs

| Output               | Description                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tasks`              | Full task list with estimates, roles, and dependencies |
| `critical_path`      | Ordered sequence of tasks that gate project completion |
| `milestones`         | Key checkpoints with target hour marks                 |
| `parallel_tracks`    | Task groups that can be worked simultaneously          |
| `buffer_hours`       | Hours reserved for integration, polish, and debugging  |
| `recommended_skills` | Suggested next skills to invoke                        |

---

## Rules

1. Decompose every MVP feature into tasks of 30 minutes to 3 hours each.
2. Include setup, integration, and deployment tasks explicitly.
3. Assign each task to exactly one role from `team_roles` (or "any" if unspecified).
4. Identify the critical path as the longest dependency chain.
5. Reserve `buffer_hours` = 15% of remaining hackathon time minimum.
6. Order `milestones` at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% of remaining time.
7. Flag any task without a clear owner as `[UNASSIGNED]`.
