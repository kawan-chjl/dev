# hackathon-demo-video

## Goal

Produce a structured script and shot list for a hackathon demo video that showcases the project's core value within a strict time limit.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- The MVP demo flow is implemented and stable
- A demo video must be recorded for submission or as a live-demo fallback
- The wow moment timing and placement in the video need to be optimized
- The recording environment must be checked and locked before recording begins
- Invoked during Phase 6; run in parallel with `hackathon-pitchdeck` after code freeze

## Inputs

| Input                    | Type     | Required | Description                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `project_title`          | string   | Yes      | Name of the project                                  |
| `tagline`                | string   | Yes      | One-sentence description                             |
| `mvp_demo_flow`          | object[] | Yes      | Demo steps from `hackathon-scope-cutter`             |
| `wow_factor`             | string   | Yes      | The single most impressive moment                    |
| `video_duration_seconds` | integer  | Yes      | Target video length in seconds                       |
| `demo_environment`       | string   | No       | Where the demo runs (e.g., web browser, mobile, CLI) |
| `voiceover`              | boolean  | No       | Whether the video includes voiceover (default: true) |

---

## Outputs

| Output                 | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `script`               | Time-coded narration script                    |
| `shot_list`            | What is shown on screen at each moment         |
| `wow_moment_timestamp` | When in the video the wow factor hits          |
| `recording_checklist`  | Pre-recording setup and validation steps       |
| `fallback_plan`        | What to do if live demo fails during recording |

---

## Rules

1. The first 5 seconds must state the problem or hook — no introductions.
2. `wow_factor` must appear before the 60% mark of `video_duration_seconds`.
3. Every `mvp_demo_flow` step must map to at least one shot.
4. Narration sentences must be under 15 words each.
5. Reserve the final 10% of video time for a summary and call-to-action.
6. `recording_checklist` must include at least: notifications off, test data ready, screen resolution set.
7. `fallback_plan` must be a static slide or pre-recorded segment, never "we'll skip this part."

## Example

**Input:**

```yaml
project_title: 'AnchorAI'
tagline: 'An AI companion that remembers your emotional journey.'
wow_factor: 'AI recalls emotional context from 3 days ago and adapts tone in real time'
video_duration_seconds: 120
demo_environment: 'web browser'
voiceover: true
mvp_demo_flow:
  - step: 1
    action: "User types 'I'm overwhelmed today'"
    outcome: 'AI responds empathetically'
  - step: 2
    action: 'User mentions recurring work stress'
    outcome: "AI references last week's conversation"
  - step: 3
    action: 'User expresses hopelessness'
    outcome: 'Crisis resource card appears'
```

**Output:**

```yaml
wow_moment_timestamp: 45

script:
  - timestamp_start: 0
    timestamp_end: 8
    narration: '40% of college students live with anxiety. Most wait 6 weeks for help.'
  - timestamp_start: 8
    timestamp_end: 15
    narration: 'AnchorAI is always available — and it remembers you.'
  - timestamp_start: 15
    timestamp_end: 45
    narration: 'Watch what happens when a student checks in after a hard week.'
  - timestamp_start: 45
    timestamp_end: 70
    narration: "AnchorAI recalls last week's conversation — without being told."
  - timestamp_start: 70
    timestamp_end: 95
    narration: 'When a student signals distress, AnchorAI responds with care and resources.'
  - timestamp_start: 95
    timestamp_end: 120
    narration: 'No waitlist. No starting over. AnchorAI — always there.'

shot_list:
  - timestamp_start: 0
    timestamp_end: 8
    screen_content: "Stat card: '40% of students report anxiety. Average wait: 6 weeks.'"
    action: 'Hold on stat card'
  - timestamp_start: 15
    timestamp_end: 45
    screen_content: 'Chat interface — user types message'
    action: "Type 'I'm feeling overwhelmed again this week'"
  - timestamp_start: 45
    timestamp_end: 70
    screen_content: "AI response references 'last week's exam stress you mentioned'"
    action: 'Scroll to highlight the memory reference in the AI response'
  - timestamp_start: 70
    timestamp_end: 95
    screen_content: 'User types hopelessness message; crisis card slides in below response'
    action: 'Type message; pause on crisis card appearing'

recording_checklist:
  - 'Notifications disabled on OS and browser'
  - 'Demo account pre-loaded with 1 prior session in Redis'
  - 'Screen resolution set to 1920×1080; browser zoom 125%'
  - "Test data: prior session summary contains 'exam stress' phrase"
  - 'Run full demo flow once before recording'

fallback_plan:
  trigger: 'OpenAI API fails to respond during recording'
  action: 'Use pre-recorded screen capture of the memory recall exchange as an overlay segment'
```
