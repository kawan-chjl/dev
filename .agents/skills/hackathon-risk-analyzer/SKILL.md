# hackathon-risk-analyzer

## Goal

Identify and rank technical, integration, and demo risks that could cause the project to fail during development or live judging, and produce actionable mitigation strategies for each risk before implementation begins.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- MVP scope is locked and the tech stack is confirmed
- The team is about to begin implementation and risk exposure is unknown
- External APIs, datasets, GPU resources, or network dependencies are involved
- A deployment environment is being used for the first time by the team
- Invoked during Phase 4 (Project Planning), after `hackathon-scope-cutter` and before the first `hackathon-code-implementer` call; re-invoke if scope or tech stack changes

## Rules

1. Classify every risk into one of: `api`, `data`, `infra`, `skill-gap`, `demo`, `time`.
2. Assign severity using: `critical` (blocks demo), `high` (likely to cause delay), `medium` (manageable), `low` (acceptable).
3. Every `critical` or `high` risk must have a concrete mitigation strategy and a fallback plan.
4. Flag any external dependency without a free tier or offline fallback as `critical`.
5. Flag any feature requiring GPU, specialized hardware, or proprietary datasets as `high` or `critical`.
6. `pre_build_actions` must address all `critical` risks before coding begins.
7. Do not invent risks; base all risks on `tech_stack`, `external_dependencies`, and `mvp_features`.

## Example

**Input:**

```yaml

tech_stack: ['Python', 'FastAPI', 'React', 'Groq API', 'Supabase']
mvp_features:
  - feature: 'GPT-4 emotional check-in conversation'
    fake_ok: false
  - feature: 'Session memory'
    fake_ok: false
  - feature: 'Crisis escalation (mocked)'
    fake_ok: true
external_dependencies:
  - 'Groq API (LLM inference)'

    fallback: 'Replace Supabase with Redis for demo; migrate after hackathon'

  - id: 'R-04'
    title: 'Context window overflow with long session summaries'
    category: 'api'
    severity: 'medium'
    description: 'Injecting long memory summaries into the system prompt may exceed model context limits'
    probability: 'medium'
