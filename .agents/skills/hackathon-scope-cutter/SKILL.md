# hackathon-scope-cutter

## Goal

Reduce a project's feature set to the minimum viable product (MVP) that can be shipped within the hackathon time limit while preserving demo impact.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- A top idea has been selected and confirmed by `hackathon-idea-scoring`
- A feature wishlist exists and must be reduced to a shippable set
- The hackathon duration and team size are known
- The team is at risk of building too much and shipping nothing
- Invoked once per project, immediately after idea selection; output is an upstream dependency for planning, implementation, and presentation skills

## Outputs

| Output               | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `mvp_features`       | Features included in the MVP                      |
| `deferred_features`  | Features cut from MVP (post-hackathon backlog)    |
| `cut_rationale`      | Why each deferred feature was cut                 |
| `mvp_demo_flow`      | Minimal user journey that demonstrates core value |
| `time_budget`        | Rough hour estimate per MVP feature               |
| `scope_risk`         | Remaining risks even after scoping                |
| `recommended_skills` | Suggested next skills to invoke                   |

## Rules

1. Include a feature in MVP only if it is required to demonstrate `core_mechanism` or `wow_factor`.
2. Default to cutting any feature that cannot be implemented in less than 20% of total time.
3. Preserve at least one visually compelling UI moment in `mvp_demo_flow`.
4. Total `time_budget` must not exceed 70% of `hackathon_duration_hours` (reserve 30% for polish and presentation).
5. Mark features as `[FAKE-OK]` if they can be simulated or hardcoded for demo purposes.
6. Do not cut the feature that delivers `wow_factor`.

## Example

**Input:**

```yaml
project_title: 'AnchorAI'
feature_wishlist:
  - 'User authentication and profiles'
  - 'GPT-4 emotional check-in conversation'
  - 'Session memory (recall past conversations)'
  - 'Mood trend dashboard'
  - 'Push notifications for daily check-ins'
  - 'Crisis escalation to hotline resources'
  - 'Onboarding quiz to personalize tone'
core_mechanism: 'GPT-4 conversation with persistent emotional context memory'
hackathon_duration_hours: 24
team_size: 3
team_skills: ['Python', 'React', 'OpenAI API']
wow_factor: 'AI recalls emotional context from past sessions and adapts tone in real time'
```

**Output:**

```yaml
mvp_features:
  - feature: 'GPT-4 emotional check-in conversation'
    purpose: 'Core mechanism — must ship'
    fake_ok: false
  - feature: 'Session memory (recall past conversations)'
    purpose: 'Delivers the wow factor'
    fake_ok: false
  - feature: 'Crisis escalation to hotline resources'
    purpose: 'Safety requirement visible to judges'
    fake_ok: true

deferred_features:
  - feature: 'User authentication and profiles'
    cut_rationale: '3–4h cost; demo uses single hardcoded session'
  - feature: 'Mood trend dashboard'
    cut_rationale: 'Not in demo flow; 4h cost'
  - feature: 'Push notifications'
    cut_rationale: 'Backend complexity; irrelevant to live demo'
  - feature: 'Onboarding quiz'
    cut_rationale: 'Can be mocked with pre-set tone for demo'

mvp_demo_flow:
  - step: 1
    action: "User opens app and types: 'I'm feeling really overwhelmed today'"
    outcome: 'AI responds empathetically with personalized opening'
  - step: 2
    action: 'User describes a recurring work stress'
    outcome: "AI references last week's similar conversation from memory"
  - step: 3
    action: 'User expresses hopelessness'
    outcome: 'AI surfaces crisis resource card gracefully'

time_budget:
  - feature: 'GPT-4 check-in conversation'
    estimated_hours: 4
  - feature: 'Session memory'
    estimated_hours: 5
  - feature: 'Crisis escalation (mocked)'
    estimated_hours: 1

scope_risk:
  - 'Memory retrieval latency may degrade demo experience on slow networks'

recommended_skills:
  - 'hackathon-task-planner'
  - 'hackathon-wow-detector'
```
