# hackathon-submission-prep

## Goal

Compile and validate all required hackathon submission artifacts into a complete, polished submission package ready for upload.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- The demo video is uploaded and the pitch deck is finalized
- Submission deadline is approaching and artifacts must be validated
- A submission platform (Devpost, Dorahacks, etc.) requires a structured description
- The team needs a checklist of what is complete versus what is still missing
- Invoked during Phase 8; submit output to the platform at least 1 hour before the deadline

## Outputs

| Output                     | Description                                          |

---

## Rules

1. `submission_description` must include: problem, solution, tech stack, team, and demo link.
2. `short_description` must be 280 characters or fewer.
3. `artifact_checklist` must verify: repo URL accessible, README exists, demo video linked, team listed.
4. Assign `submission_quality_score` using: completeness (40%), clarity (30%), impact framing (30%).
5. `last_mile_actions` must be ordered by priority with estimated time per action.
6. Flag any missing required field from `custom_fields` as a blocking `missing_artifact`.
7. Do not submit placeholder text; flag any `[TBD]` fields as incomplete in `missing_artifacts`.

## Example

**Input:**

```yaml
project_title: 'AnchorAI'
tagline: 'An AI companion that remembers your emotional journey so you never have to start over.'
problem_statement: 'College students wait 6 weeks for counseling while anxiety compounds daily.'
solution_summary: 'GPT-4 with Redis-backed session memory for always-available, context-aware emotional support.'
tech_stack: ['Python', 'FastAPI', 'React', 'Redis', 'OpenAI GPT-4']
team_members:
  - name: 'Alex'
    role: 'Backend'
  - name: 'Sam'
    role: 'Frontend'
  - name: 'Jordan'
    role: 'Design'
repo_url: 'https://github.com/team/anchorai'
track: 'AI for Mental Health'
submission_platform: 'Devpost'
```

**Output:**

```yaml

  ## Inspiration
  40% of college students report anxiety as their top health concern, yet the average campus counseling wait is 6 weeks. Most students give up before they're seen.

  ## What It Does
  AnchorAI is a GPT-4 powered emotional support companion that remembers your history across sessions. It opens every conversation with context from your last check-in — so you never have to re-explain your situation.

  ## How We Built It
  Python FastAPI backend with OpenAI GPT-4 API. Session summaries stored in Redis and injected into the system prompt. React frontend with a clean single-page chat UI.

  ## Challenges
  Getting memory injection to stay within GPT-4 context window limits required hard-capping summaries at 150 tokens and testing multiple summarization prompts.

  ## Accomplishments
  Working live demo with genuine session memory recall. Crisis escalation card renders on distress detection.

  ## What We Learned
  The emotional framing of AI responses matters more than technical sophistication. Users notice tone before they notice features.

  ## What's Next
  Human counselor escalation. University licensing. Multi-session longitudinal mood tracking.
