  Generate demo-path test cases and a manual verification checklist to prevent demo failures during judging.

# hackathon-test-generator

## Goal

Generate a focused set of test cases and a lightweight test coverage plan that validates the demo flow without requiring full test suite completeness.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- Core MVP features have been implemented and the demo flow is connected end-to-end
- Done criteria from `hackathon-code-implementer` are available
- The team needs to verify the demo will not crash before judging
- Manual verification steps are needed for a quick pre-demo sanity check
- Invoked once after the implementation phase stabilizes; re-invoke after any demo-path bug fix

## Inputs

| Input               | Type     | Required | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `mvp_features`      | string[] | Yes      | MVP features from `hackathon-scope-cutter`      |
| `mvp_demo_flow`     | object[] | Yes      | Demo flow steps from `hackathon-scope-cutter`   |
| `tech_stack`        | string[] | Yes      | Technologies in use                             |
| `done_criteria`     | string[] | Yes      | Done criteria from `hackathon-code-implementer` |
| `time_budget_hours` | number   | Yes      | Hours available for testing                     |

## Outputs

| Output           | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `test_cases`     | Prioritized test cases covering the demo flow      |
| `coverage_plan`  | What is tested vs. intentionally untested          |
| `test_scaffolds` | Minimal test stubs to start from                   |
| `manual_checks`  | Quick manual verification steps for demo readiness |
| `demo_blockers`  | Failure conditions that would break the demo       |

---

## Rules

1. Prioritize tests that protect the `mvp_demo_flow` above all other coverage.
2. Generate at minimum one test per `done_criterion`.
3. Mark any test not critical to the demo as `[NICE-TO-HAVE]`.
4. Include at least one negative/edge case test per MVP feature.
5. `test_scaffolds` must use the testing framework standard for the primary `tech_stack` language.
6. `manual_checks` must be completable in under 5 minutes total.
7. Any scenario that would cause a live demo failure must appear in `demo_blockers`.

## Example

**Input:**

```yaml
mvp_features: ['GPT-4 check-in conversation', 'Session memory', 'Crisis escalation (mocked)']
mvp_demo_flow:
  - step: 2
    action: 'User describes recurring work stress'
    outcome: "AI references last week's similar conversation from memory"
  - step: 3
    action: 'User expresses hopelessness'
    outcome: 'AI surfaces crisis resource card'
tech_stack: ['Python', 'FastAPI', 'React', 'Redis']
done_criteria:
  - 'New chat session shows AI referencing previous session content'
  - 'Redis key contains non-empty summary after session ends'
time_budget_hours: 2
```

**Output:**

```yaml
test_cases:
  - id: 'TC-01'
    feature: 'Session memory'
    description: 'AI references prior session context in a new session'
    type: 'e2e'
    priority: 'critical'
    input: "Start session 1, say 'I'm anxious about exams'. End session. Start session 2."
    expected_output: 'AI opening references exam anxiety from prior session'

  - id: 'TC-02'
    feature: 'Session memory'
    description: 'Redis key is populated after session ends'
    type: 'integration'
    priority: 'critical'
    input: 'Complete one chat session'
    expected_output: "redis.get('user:demo:summary') returns non-empty string"

  - id: 'TC-03'
    feature: 'Crisis escalation'
    description: 'Crisis card appears when hopelessness language is detected'
    type: 'e2e'
    priority: 'critical'
    input: "User types 'I feel completely hopeless'"
    expected_output: 'Crisis resource card rendered below AI response'

  - id: 'TC-04'
    feature: 'GPT-4 conversation'
    description: 'Empty input does not crash the endpoint'
    type: 'unit'
    priority: '[NICE-TO-HAVE]'
    input: 'POST /chat with empty message body'
    expected_output: 'HTTP 422 or graceful error response'

coverage_plan:
  covered:
    - 'Demo flow steps 1–3'
    - 'Memory persistence'
    - 'Crisis card trigger'
  intentionally_skipped:
    - area: 'Authentication'
      reason: 'Not in MVP; hardcoded demo session'
    - area: 'Concurrent users'
      reason: 'Single-demo scenario; not required for judging'

test_scaffolds:
  - label: 'Memory integration test'
    language: 'python'
    snippet: |
      def test_memory_persists():
          save_memory("demo", "User is anxious about exams.")
          assert get_memory("demo") == "User is anxious about exams."

manual_checks:
  - step: 1
    action: 'Run full demo flow from a clean Redis state'
    pass_condition: 'AI references prior context at step 2 without prompting'
  - step: 2
    action: "Type 'I feel hopeless' into chat"
    pass_condition: 'Crisis resource card appears within 3 seconds'

demo_blockers:
  - scenario: 'Redis not running when demo starts'
    mitigation: "Add startup check; document 'redis-server' as pre-demo step in run guide"
  - scenario: 'OpenAI API rate limit hit during live demo'
    mitigation: 'Use pre-recorded screen capture of the memory recall moment as backup'
```
