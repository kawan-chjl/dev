# hackathon-event-parser

## Goal

Parse a hackathon event URL to extract structured information — tracks, judging criteria, timeline, and sponsor tools — required to trigger the full devkit workflow pipeline autonomously.

This is the **autonomous pipeline entry point**. When a URL is provided, this skill replaces manual track description input for all downstream skills.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- A hackathon event URL is available (Devpost, DoraHacks, Hackathon.com, MLH, or any event page)
- The team wants to run the devkit pipeline autonomously from a single input
- Track descriptions, judging criteria, or sponsor briefs must be extracted without manual copying
- Multiple tracks exist on an event page and the best-fit track must be identified
- This is always the **first skill invoked** in an autonomous pipeline; its output feeds `hackathon-track-analyzer`

---

## Inputs

```yaml
event_url: '<hackathon event URL>' # required
preferred_track: '<track name or hint>' # optional — if known, used to prioritize extraction
team_size: <number> # optional — used to filter feasibility signals
team_skills: # optional — used to flag relevant sponsor tools
  - '<skill>'
extract_mode: 'full | tracks_only | criteria_only' # optional, default: full
```

---

## Outputs

```yaml
event_metadata:
  name: '<event name>'
  organizer: '<organizer name>'
  url: '<canonical event URL>'
  submission_platform: '<Devpost | DoraHacks | Hackathon.com | other>'
  start_datetime: "<ISO 8601 or 'unknown'>"
  end_datetime: "<ISO 8601 or 'unknown'>"
  duration_hours: <number or null>
  location: '<in-person | virtual | hybrid>'
  registration_deadline: "<ISO 8601 or 'unknown'>"
  submission_deadline: "<ISO 8601 or 'unknown'>"

tracks:
  - id: '<track-id>'
    name: '<track name>'
    description: '<raw track description>'
    sponsor: '<sponsor name or null>'
    prize: '<prize description or null>'
    required_tools:
      - '<tool or API name>'
    eligibility_constraints:
      - '<constraint>'
    feasibility_signal: '<high | medium | low>' # based on team_skills if provided

judging_criteria:
  - track_id: "<track-id or 'global'>"
    axes:
      - axis: '<criterion name>'
        weight: '<high | medium | low | percentage if stated>'
        description: '<what judges evaluate>'
    rubric_source: '<verbatim | inferred | not_published>'

sponsor_tools:
  - sponsor: '<sponsor name>'
    tools:
      - name: '<tool or API>'
        use_case: '<what it enables>'
        bonus_prize: <true | false>
        docs_url: '<URL or null>'

timeline:
  - event: '<event name>'
    datetime: '<ISO 8601 or relative>'
    notes: '<optional context>'

recommended_track:
  track_id: '<id>'
  track_name: '<name>'
  rationale: '<why this track is recommended given team size/skills>'

extraction_confidence: '<high | medium | low>'
extraction_warnings:
  - '<any ambiguity, missing data, or access issues>'

next_skill: 'hackathon-track-analyzer'
```

## Rules

1. Extract all content directly from the event page without inference where possible.
2. If the judging rubric is not published, set `rubric_source: "not_published"` and infer typical criteria — mark inferred axes with `[INFERRED]`.
3. If the URL is inaccessible (auth wall, 404, dynamic content), set `extraction_confidence: "low"` and populate fields from available fragments; list all gaps in `extraction_warnings`.
4. Never fabricate dates, prizes, or sponsor names. Use `"unknown"` or `null` for missing values.
5. If multiple tracks exist, extract all tracks and recommend one based on team signals if provided.
6. Normalize duration to hours. If only start/end dates are given, compute `duration_hours`.
7. Flag any required tool or API that conflicts with `team_skills` as a constraint.
8. `next_skill` must always be set to `hackathon-track-analyzer` to enforce pipeline continuity.
