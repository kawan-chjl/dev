# hackathon-idea-scoring

## Goal

Evaluate and rank candidate project ideas against a weighted scoring rubric aligned with hackathon judging criteria and team capabilities.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- A list of candidate ideas is available from `hackathon-idea-generator`
- `evaluation_axes` from `hackathon-track-analyzer` are confirmed
- The team must converge on a single idea before scoping begins
- Objective comparison is needed to resolve disagreement between team members
- Invoked directly after `hackathon-idea-generator`; output gates all subsequent phases

## Inputs

| Input                      | Type     | Required | Description                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ideas`                    | object[] | Yes      | Ideas list from `hackathon-idea-generator`         |
| `evaluation_axes`          | object[] | Yes      | Scoring axes from `hackathon-track-analyzer`       |
| `team_skills`              | string[] | Yes      | Technologies and domains the team is proficient in |
| `hackathon_duration_hours` | integer  | Yes      | Total hours available                              |
| `team_size`                | integer  | Yes      | Number of team members                             |
| `weights`                  | object   | No       | Custom weight overrides per evaluation axis        |

## Outputs

| Output               | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `scored_ideas`       | Each idea with scores per axis and total score |
| `ranking`            | Ordered list of ideas by total score           |
| `top_recommendation` | Single recommended idea with rationale         |
| `risk_flags`         | Concerns for each top-3 idea                   |
| `recommended_skills` | Suggested next skills to invoke                |

---

## Rules

1. Score every idea on every evaluation axis using a 1–5 scale.
2. Apply axis weights when computing total score; default weight is 1.0 if not specified.
3. Apply a `feasibility_penalty` (-0.5 per axis point) if the team lacks skills required.
4. Apply a `time_penalty` (-1.0) if the idea cannot realistically ship in `hackathon_duration_hours`.
5. Surface at least one risk flag per top-3 idea.
6. Select `top_recommendation` based on highest adjusted total score.
7. Break ties in favor of the idea with the highest feasibility score.

## Example

**Input:**

```yaml
ideas:
  - id: 'idea-1'
    title: 'AnchorAI'
    risk_level: 'medium'
  - id: 'idea-3'
    title: 'CalmDraft'
    risk_level: 'low'
evaluation_axes:
  - axis: 'Innovation'
    weight: 1.5
  - axis: 'Impact'
    weight: 1.5
  - axis: 'Technical Execution'
    weight: 1.0
team_skills: ['Python', 'React', 'OpenAI API']
hackathon_duration_hours: 24
team_size: 3
```

**Output:**

```yaml
scored_ideas:
  - id: 'idea-1'
    title: 'AnchorAI'
    scores:
      - axis: 'Innovation'
        score: 4
        notes: 'Memory layer is novel; similar products exist but not for this audience'
      - axis: 'Impact'
        score: 5
        notes: 'Addresses acute unmet need at scale'
      - axis: 'Technical Execution'
        score: 3
        notes: 'Memory persistence adds integration complexity'
    penalties: []
    total_score: 17.5

  - id: 'idea-3'
    title: 'CalmDraft'
    scores:
      - axis: 'Innovation'
        score: 3
        notes: 'CBT journaling apps exist; GPT reframing is incremental'
      - axis: 'Impact'
        score: 4
        notes: 'Reaches self-directed users effectively'
      - axis: 'Technical Execution'

        notes: 'Well within team skills; highly shippable in 24h'
    penalties: []
    total_score: 16.5

ranking:
  - rank: 1
    id: 'idea-1'
    total_score: 17.5
  - rank: 2
