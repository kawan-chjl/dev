# hackathon-track-analyzer

## Goal

Parse hackathon track descriptions, sponsor briefs, and theme statements to extract structured constraints, evaluation criteria, and strategic opportunities.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- A hackathon track description, theme, or event page is available
- Sponsor briefs or prize track details need to be parsed
- Judging criteria or a scoring rubric must be structured before ideation begins
- The team needs to understand disqualifying constraints before committing to an idea
- This is always the **first skill invoked** in any hackathon workflow

---

## Inputs

| Input                      | Type     | Required | Description                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `track_description`        | string   | Yes      | Raw text of the hackathon track or theme announcement |
| `sponsor_briefs`           | string[] | No       | Sponsor challenge briefs or prize track descriptions  |
| `judging_rubric`           | string   | No       | Any published judging criteria or scoring rubric      |
| `hackathon_duration_hours` | integer  | Yes      | Total hackathon duration in hours                     |

## Outputs

| Output                    | Description                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `track_summary`           | One-sentence summary of the track's core theme             |
| `required_constraints`    | Mandatory constraints teams must satisfy                   |
| `optional_constraints`    | Nice-to-have constraints for bonus scoring                 |
| `sponsor_priorities`      | Ordered list of what each sponsor values most              |
| `evaluation_axes`         | Scoring dimensions extracted from rubric or inferred       |
| `strategic_opportunities` | High-leverage angles or underserved areas within the track |
| `disqualifiers`           | Conditions that would disqualify a submission              |
| `recommended_skills`      | Suggested devkit skills to invoke next                     |

---

## Rules

1. Extract only what is explicitly stated or strongly implied; do not fabricate constraints.
2. Prioritize mandatory constraints over optional ones.
3. Flag ambiguous language with `[AMBIGUOUS]` marker.
4. Map each sponsor's stated priorities to 1–3 concrete actionable requirements.
5. Identify at least one underexplored strategic opportunity per track.
6. Output `recommended_skills` drawn only from the hackathon-ai-devkit skill list.

## Output Format

```yaml
track_summary: '<string>'

required_constraints:
  - '<constraint>'

optional_constraints:
  - '<constraint>'

sponsor_priorities:
  - sponsor: '<name>'
    priorities:
      - '<priority>'

evaluation_axes:
  - axis: '<name>'
    weight: '<high|medium|low>'
    description: '<string>'

strategic_opportunities:
  - '<opportunity>'

disqualifiers:
  - '<condition>'

recommended_skills:
  - '<skill-name>'
```

## Example

**Input:**

```yaml
track_description: 'Build solutions that use AI to improve mental health outcomes for young adults.'
sponsor_briefs:
  - 'OpenAI: Best use of GPT-4 API for empathetic user interactions'
judging_rubric: 'Innovation (30%), Impact (30%), Technical execution (20%), Presentation (20%)'
hackathon_duration_hours: 24
```

**Output:**

```yaml
track_summary: 'Use AI to improve mental health outcomes for young adults.'

required_constraints:
  - 'Solution must demonstrably address mental health for ages 18–30'

optional_constraints:
  - 'Bonus scoring for use of OpenAI GPT-4 API'

sponsor_priorities:
  - sponsor: 'OpenAI'
    priorities:
      - 'Empathetic, context-aware conversational responses'
      - 'Responsible AI usage with safety guardrails'

evaluation_axes:
  - axis: 'Innovation'
    weight: 'high'
    description: 'Novel approach to mental health support beyond generic chatbots'
  - axis: 'Impact'
    weight: 'high'
    description: 'Measurable improvement in user wellbeing or access to resources'

strategic_opportunities:
  - 'Underserved: peer-support facilitation rather than direct therapy replacement'

disqualifiers:
  - 'Solutions that claim to diagnose or treat clinical conditions'

recommended_skills:
  - 'hackathon-problem-space'
  - 'hackathon-idea-generator'
```
