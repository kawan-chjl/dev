# hackathon-doc-writer

## Goal

Generate structured technical documentation artifacts (ADR, PRD, feature specs) for a hackathon project using the appropriate template.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- MVP scope is locked and needs to be documented in a PRD
- An architectural decision has been made that should be recorded in an ADR
- A specific feature needs a formal spec before implementation begins
- Invoked during Phase 4 (Project Planning), after `hackathon-scope-cutter` completes
- Can be re-invoked any time a new architectural decision is made during implementation

## Inputs

| Input                    | Type     | Required | Description                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `document_type`          | enum     | Yes      | One of: `ADR`, `PRD`, `feature-spec`                  |
| `project_title`          | string   | Yes      | Name of the project                                   |
| `problem_statement`      | string   | Yes      | Core problem being solved                             |
| `mvp_features`           | string[] | Yes      | MVP feature list from `hackathon-scope-cutter`        |
| `tech_stack`             | string[] | Yes      | Technologies being used                               |
| `architecture_decisions` | object[] | No       | For ADR: list of decisions with context and rationale |
| `feature_name`           | string   | No       | For feature-spec: name of the specific feature        |
| `constraints`            | string[] | No       | Technical or product constraints                      |

## Outputs

| Output           | Description                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `document`       | Fully populated document in Markdown                      |
| `document_type`  | Type of document generated                                |
| `missing_fields` | Sections that could not be completed due to missing input |

---

## Rules

1. Use the corresponding template from `../hackathon-shared-resources/templates/` directory as the output structure.
2. Do not omit any section from the template; use `[TBD]` for missing information.
3. Keep language direct and scannable — no filler paragraphs.
4. For ADR: capture exactly one architectural decision per document.
5. For PRD: include success metrics even if they are estimates.
6. For feature-spec: include acceptance criteria as testable conditions.
7. Flag all `[TBD]` sections in `missing_fields` output.

---

## Output Format

```yaml
document_type: '<ADR|PRD|feature-spec>'

missing_fields:
  - '<section name>'

document: |
  <Full Markdown document content>
```

## Example

**Input:**

```yaml
document_type: 'ADR'
project_title: 'AnchorAI'
problem_statement: 'How might we provide always-available emotional support for college students?'
mvp_features:
  - 'GPT-4 emotional check-in conversation'
  - 'Session memory'
tech_stack: ['Python', 'FastAPI', 'React', 'OpenAI API', 'Redis']
architecture_decisions:
  - title: 'Session memory storage'
    context: 'Need to persist conversation summaries between sessions'
    options: ['Redis (in-memory)', 'SQLite (file)', 'OpenAI conversation history API']
    decision: 'Redis'
    rationale: 'Fastest to set up; sufficient for demo; team familiar with it'
```

**Output:**

```yaml
document_type: 'ADR'
missing_fields: []
document: |
  # ADR-001: Session Memory Storage

  **Date:** 2025-06-14
  **Status:** Accepted

  ## Context
  AnchorAI must recall emotional context from past user sessions to deliver its core wow factor.
  Memory must persist across browser refreshes for the demo.

  ## Decision
  Use Redis as an in-process session store keyed by a hardcoded demo user ID.

  ## Consequences
  - Positive: Setup takes <30 minutes; team knows Redis well
  - Negative: Data is lost on server restart; not production-ready
  - Risk: Redis unavailable on demo machine → mitigation: fallback to in-memory dict
```
