# hackathon-problem-space

## Goal

Map the problem domain for a hackathon project by identifying target users, core pain points, existing solutions, and whitespace opportunities.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- A hackathon track has been analyzed and `track_summary` is available
- The team needs to identify who the target user is before generating ideas
- The problem domain is broad and must be narrowed before ideation
- Existing solutions must be surveyed to identify gaps worth exploiting
- Invoked immediately after `hackathon-track-analyzer` completes

## Inputs

| Input              | Type     | Required | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `track_summary`    | string   | Yes      | Output from `hackathon-track-analyzer` or manual description |
| `domain`           | string   | Yes      | Broad domain area (e.g., healthcare, fintech, education)     |
| `target_user_hint` | string   | No       | Initial hypothesis about target user segment                 |
| `constraints`      | string[] | No       | Known technical or sponsor constraints                       |

## Outputs

| Output               | Description                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_segments`      | Identified user groups with brief profiles                 |
| `pain_points`        | Ranked list of pain points per user segment                |
| `existing_solutions` | Known tools or approaches currently addressing the problem |
| `solution_gaps`      | Gaps in existing solutions that represent opportunity      |
| `problem_statement`  | One-sentence problem statement (how-might-we format)       |
| `market_signals`     | Evidence that this problem is real and worth solving       |
| `recommended_skills` | Suggested next skills to invoke                            |

---

## Rules

1. Identify at least 2 distinct user segments.
2. Rank pain points from most to least severe for each segment.
3. List at least 3 existing solutions with their key limitations.
4. Derive solution gaps from the delta between pain points and existing solution limitations.
5. Write the problem statement as: "How might we [action] for [user] so that [outcome]?"
6. Do not invent market signals; clearly mark inferred signals as `[INFERRED]`.

## Example

**Input:**

```yaml
track_summary: 'Use AI to improve mental health outcomes for young adults.'
domain: 'mental health / digital health'
target_user_hint: 'college students experiencing anxiety'
constraints:
  - 'Must use OpenAI GPT-4 API'
```

**Output:**

```yaml
user_segments:
  - segment: 'College students'
    profile: 'Ages 18–22, high stress, low access to campus counseling'
  - segment: 'Young professionals'
    profile: 'Ages 23–30, work-related burnout, too busy for scheduled therapy'

pain_points:
  - segment: 'College students'
    pains:
      - severity: 'high'
        description: '2–6 week wait times for campus counseling appointments'
      - severity: 'high'
        description: 'Stigma prevents help-seeking behavior'

existing_solutions:
  - name: 'Woebot'
    limitation: 'Rigid scripted responses; no memory across sessions'
  - name: 'BetterHelp'
    limitation: 'Expensive ($60–$100/week); not accessible to students'
  - name: 'Headspace'
    limitation: 'Meditation only; does not address acute anxiety episodes'

solution_gaps:
  - 'No affordable, always-available, context-aware emotional support for acute moments'
  - 'No peer-community facilitation layer between self-help and professional care'

problem_statement: 'How might we provide always-available emotional support for college students so that they can manage anxiety between professional appointments?'

market_signals:
  - source: 'real'
    signal: '40% of US college students reported anxiety as top mental health concern (ACHA 2023)'
  - source: '[INFERRED]'
    signal: 'Rising demand for async, text-based support given phone anxiety in Gen Z'

recommended_skills:
  - 'hackathon-idea-generator'
