# hackathon-milestone-monitor

## Goal

Evaluate current project progress against the planned milestone schedule, identify slippage or risk, and recommend concrete next actions to ensure the demo is ready before judging begins.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- A milestone check-in is due (at 25%, 50%, 75%, or 90% of hackathon time)
- The team is uncertain whether they are on track
- A task has significantly overrun its time budget
- A scope change has occurred and the plan needs to be reassessed
- Invoked during Phase 5 (Build) at each milestone marker; re-invoke any time the critical path is threatened

## Rules

1. Compute `percent_complete` as `completed_tasks / total_tasks × 100`.
2. Compute `percent_time_used` as `elapsed_hours / hackathon_duration_hours × 100`.
3. If `percent_complete < percent_time_used - 15`, flag status as `behind`.
4. If `percent_complete > percent_time_used`, flag status as `ahead`.
5. Otherwise flag status as `on_track`.
6. Any task on the critical path that is blocked must generate a `critical` recommended action.
7. If `percent_time_used > 75` and the demo flow is not yet connected end-to-end, recommend scope cuts immediately.
8. `scope_recommendations` must only cut features that are not `[FAKE-OK]` impossible and not the wow-factor feature.

## Example

**Input:**

```yaml
project_title: 'AnchorAI'
hackathon_duration_hours: 24
elapsed_hours: 14
milestones:
  - name: 'Backend skeleton live'
    target_hour: 7
  - name: 'Frontend connected'
    target_hour: 11
  - name: 'Memory working'
    target_hour: 16
  - name: 'Demo-ready'
    target_hour: 19
tasks:
  - id: 'T-01'
    title: 'Set up FastAPI and Supabase'
  - id: 'T-02'
    title: 'Implement OpenAI chat endpoint'
  - id: 'T-03'
    title: 'Implement session memory'
  - id: 'T-04'
    title: 'Build chat UI component'
  - id: 'T-05'
    title: 'Wire frontend to API'
  - id: 'T-06'
    title: 'Add crisis card (mocked)'
completed_tasks: ['T-01', 'T-02', 'T-04']
blocked_tasks:
  - id: 'T-03'
    reason: 'Supabase cold-start issue unresolved; falling back to Redis'
```

**Output:**

```yaml
progress_report:
  completed_tasks: 3
  total_tasks: 6
  percent_complete: 50
  percent_time_used: 58
  status: 'behind'
  summary: '3 of 6 tasks done at 58% time used; session memory is blocked and the demo flow is not yet connected.'

current_phase: 'Phase 5 — Implementation'

milestone_status:
  - name: 'Backend skeleton live'
    target_hour: 7
    actual_hour: 8
    status: 'completed'
    notes: 'Completed 1 hour late due to Supabase setup delay'
  - name: 'Frontend connected'
    target_hour: 11
    actual_hour: 'not yet reached'
    status: 'at_risk'
    notes: 'T-05 (wire frontend) is blocked on T-03 (session memory); UI is built but not connected'
  - name: 'Memory working'
    target_hour: 16
    actual_hour: 'not yet reached'
    status: 'at_risk'
    notes: 'T-03 is blocked; 2 hours remain before this milestone'
  - name: 'Demo-ready'
    target_hour: 19
    actual_hour: 'not yet reached'
    status: 'at_risk'
    notes: 'Only 5 hours to complete T-03, T-05, T-06 and run full demo flow'

critical_path_health:
  status: 'at_risk'
  bottleneck_task: 'T-03'
  description: 'Session memory (T-03) is blocked; it gates T-05 (frontend wiring) which gates demo-readiness'

recommended_actions:
  - priority: 1
    urgency: 'immediate'
    action: 'Abandon Supabase for session memory; switch to Redis in-memory fallback — saves 1–2 hours'
    rationale: 'T-03 has been blocked for >1 hour; Redis fallback was planned in risk analysis'
  - priority: 2
    urgency: 'this_hour'
    action: 'Start T-05 (frontend wiring) using a hardcoded stub memory response while T-03 is resolved'
    rationale: 'Decouples frontend progress from memory implementation; demo flow can proceed in parallel'
  - priority: 3
    urgency: 'today'
    action: 'Run full demo flow end-to-end by H+16 even if memory is mocked — freeze demo path first'
    rationale: 'Demo-readiness milestone at H+19 requires 3 clean end-to-end runs'

scope_recommendations:
  - feature: 'Mood trend dashboard'
    recommendation: 'cut'
    time_saved_hours: 3
    rationale: 'Not in MVP demo flow; team is behind schedule; dashboard was already deferred'

recommended_skills:
  - 'hackathon-code-implementer'
  - 'hackathon-deployment-prep'
